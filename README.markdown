**What is ILScopeBar?**
	ILScopebar is a NSView subclass for a scope bar like the one finder uses in it's search. It is different from MGScopebar and apple's scope bar because instead of grouping, it consolidates all the items that don't fit into a menu at the end of it.


**Documentation:**
	No documentation yet. I'm probably going to add of the Doxygen tags and generate some doc files at the later stages of the development.
